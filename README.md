# RokuFirstTests-AmorphousGridAndInstagrid

These are my first attempts with Brightscript and Scenegraph, in which I display posters by controlling their attributes using a JSON file and loading them without the use of preconfigured list and grids.

The first one presents the content in an “amorphous grid”, and the another organizes content imitating Instagram grid, with a pre-visualization of the content, and
adjustable attributes as item’s width and height, and rows and columns number.

You can previsualize them in the next links:
